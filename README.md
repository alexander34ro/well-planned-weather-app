# Well Planned React Weather App
Using React.js - Built with the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A simple weather app that allows you to get current weather information, based on the city you enter.

Inspired by a nice article on Medium.
